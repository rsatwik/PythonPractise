# Python_Practise
This repository contains programs written in python language for practise. Additional observations on the working of the programs have been added as comments. Most of the programs are from the Python tutorials at https://spoken-tutorial.org/ and were written here for practice. Additionally some extra python codes are also added for reference and practise.
